Kele is a simple API client built to pull student and staff data from [Bloc's](http://www.bloc.io) API. It was written as a Ruby Gem, and uses HTTParty and JSON parsing to consume information in a readable and useful way. Given other APIs and types of requests, it could easily be used to pull data from other sources. In fact, here's some examples:

**Kele consuming the Star Wars API**
